    <h1>What are the Northern Lights?</h1>
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd0MpTRpa7E" target="_blank"><img src="images/video_placeholder.jpg" border="0" alt="Video Placeholder:  NASA Northern Lights over US and Canada" class="img_right" /></a>
    <p>The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter 
      the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 
      '<strong>Aurora borealis</strong>' in the north and <strong>'Aurora australis</strong>' in the south...</p>
    <p>Auroral displays appear in many colors although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and 
      violet have been reported. The lights appear in many forms from patches or scattered clouds of light to streamers, arcs, rippling curtains 
      or shooting rays that light up the sky with an eerie glow.</p>
    <h2>What causes the Northern Lights?</h2>
    <p>The Northern Lights are actually the result of collisions  between gaseous particles in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth" target="_blank">Earth's atmosphere</a> with charged particles  released from the sun's atmosphere. Variations in color are due to the type of  gas particles that are colliding. The most common auroral color, a pale  yellowish-green, is produced by oxygen molecules located about 60 miles above  the earth. Rare, all-red auroras are produced by high-altitude oxygen, at  heights of up to 200 miles. Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora.</p>
    <h2>The Best Places to Watch</h2>
    <p>Because the phenomena occurs near the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Magnetic_Pole" target="_blank">magnetic poles</a>,  northern lights have been seen as far south as New Orleans in the western  hemisphere, while similar locations in the east never experience the mysterious  lights. However the best places to watch the lights (in North America) are in  the northwestern parts of Canada, particularly the Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest  Territories and Alaska. Auroral displays can also be seen over the southern tip  of Greenland and Iceland, the northern coast of Norway and over the coastal  waters north of Siberia. Southern auroras are not often seen as they are  concentrated in a ring around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" target="_blank">Antarctica</a> and the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
